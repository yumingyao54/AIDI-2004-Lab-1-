Description:
This program calculates the area of a rectangle based on user input for the length and width. It defines a function called calculate_rectangle_area that takes two parameters, length and width, and returns the calculated area by multiplying the length and width together. The program then prompts the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle, converts the inputs to floats, and calls the calculate_rectangle_area function with the provided values. Finally, it outputs the result by printing the calculated area of the rectangle.
